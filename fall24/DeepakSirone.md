### Bellerophon: Non-Interactive and Verifier-Free Remote Attestation

### Abstract

Remote Attestation is a protocol by which a trusted remote verifier is convinced of the initial software state of a trusted execution environment (TEE). In the cloud setting, the trusted verifier is a large part of the software trusted computing base (TCB) since it is an always available, replicated distributed system that must securely handle multiple copies of user provided secrets. Further, provisioning of secrets into the TEE requires at least one round trip with the trusted verifier, increasing the startup latency of the TEE. We present Bellerophon, an attestation mechanism that eliminates the trusted verifier by using encrypted binaries embedded with user secrets. The binary can be decrypted only with a manufacturer-provisioned decryption key and only when the TEE is correctly initialized. This removes the trusted remote verifier and associated communication costs from prior designs. Bellerophon uses Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE) to simplify key management by generating unique decryption keys, and incorporates a key-rotation mechanism for forward security. Our evaluation shows that Bellerophon provides comparable security to existing interactive attestation mechanisms at much lower latency.
